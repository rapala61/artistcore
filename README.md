# What it is

A RESTful API that will respond with the name and score of a movie actor.

# What is the score based on?

The score is based on all of the movies they have performed. The actor will have a better rating if most of the movies he/she/they performed in have high ratings.

# Why make this?

### A few reasons:

1. I don't know of an API that does this specifically.
2. Produce a robust, tested, leading edge stack project.
3. Practice with tools that are new to me, but want to know more about.
